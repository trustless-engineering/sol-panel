## Description

SOL Panel is an open-source composability platform designed to simplify the creation and orchestration of data pipelines from Solana.

> NOTE: SOL Panel is in it's infancy! Some of the documentation is for very near-future state as we ramp up the project. If something doesn't work quite right, we encourage you to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/xRRKucEMzz) and ask for help!

## Features

- Data Extraction: Connect with a multitude of data sources, including directly to Solana RPC.
- Data Pipelines: Design and manage data pipelines for streamlined data processing and analysis.
- Specialized for Solana: Focused support and tools specifically for the Solana blockchain.
- Low-Code/No-Code System: Utilize a collection of plugins to construct APIs, webhooks, and event streams without the need for extensive coding.
