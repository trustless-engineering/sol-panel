Contributing to SOL Panel is easiest done via Github Codespaces.
Simply create a new Codespace from this branch and all the dependencies will be pre-configured for you.
You can then connect directly to the Codespace from VS Code.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes <RequiredVersion component="kubernetes" />+ Cluster
-

## Recommended Setups

There are various tooling configurations that work with developing on SOL Panel.
Some are better than others, and some can lead to hours of headaches.

### Github Codespaces

Github Codespaces allow anyone with a browser to contribute to SOL Panel! You can be building pipelines in just a few minutes by clicking the button below.

:::tip Launch SOL Panel Codespace

**_NOTE:_** A codespace with **_4 CPU/8GB RAM_** minimum is highly suggested. The number of dependencies within the Helm chart make 4GB of RAM simply too little.

### Tilt

[Tilt](https://tilt.dev) is a project that enables local development of a Kubernetes cluster. It does this by running a Kind cluster inside of Docker.

Installing Tilt can be done by following the instructions for your operating system [here](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html).

## First Time Initialization

After you first clone the repo, you will need to run a few commands to get started.

#### Seed Databases

Seeding the database provides you with some sane defaults to start with:

```bash
pnpm prisma db seed
```

#### Create Cluster

```bash
ctlptl apply -f tilt/cluster.yml
```

#### Start Application

```bash
tilt up
```

After a few moments, the application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Making Changes

Any changes made in your local environment will automatically be copied into the running container, no rebuilding required!
