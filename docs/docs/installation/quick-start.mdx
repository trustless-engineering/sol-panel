## Pre-Flight

SOL Panel currently requires Kubernetes **<RequiredVersion component="kubernetes" />** or higher. Most cloud providers can satisify this requirement.

## Using Helm (recommended)

To install SOL Panel on a Kubernetes **<RequiredVersion component="kubernetes" />+** cluster, we recommend using Helm:

```bash title="Install with Helm"
helm repo add trustless-engineering https://charts.trustless.engineering
helm install trustless-engineering/sol-panel
```

This will provision the default values, with Postgres and Redis running in-cluster. You can access the default UI by port-forwarding the `frontend` service.
