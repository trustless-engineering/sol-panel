# Quick Start

## Pre-Flight

SOL Panel is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, and this is the primary dependency to running SOL Panel.

SOL Panel currently requires Kubernetes **<RequiredVersion component="kubernetes" />** or higher. Most cloud providers can satisify this requirement.

## Using Helm (recommended)

To install SOL Panel on a Kubernetes **<RequiredVersion component="kubernetes" />+** cluster, we recommend using Helm:

```bash title="Install with Helm"
helm repo add trustless-engineering https://charts.trustless.engineering
helm install trustless-engineering/sol-panel
```
